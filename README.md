# TAOBench Workloads
We present TAOBench workloads, the data behind our work on [TAOBench: An End-to-End Benchmark for Social Network Workloads](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p1965-cheng.pdf). These provide the foundation for a new distributed database benchmark based on Meta's social graph workloads, can be used to accurately simulate the production request patterns of an online social network.
